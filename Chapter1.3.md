# Types of Operating Systems

### 1st Generation - No Operating System
- **Manual operation**: 
  - Early computers had no operating system.
  - Programs were executed manually by users, often using switches and punch cards.

### 2nd Generation - Magnetic Tapes (No Operating System)
- **Batch Processing**: 
  - Programs were loaded sequentially using punch cards and magnetic tapes.
  - There was no operating system, and users interacted directly with hardware.

### 3rd Generation - Magnetic Disk (Hard Disk) & Floppy Disk
- **Uniprogramming**: 
  - The OS could hold a single program in memory at a time.
  - CPU remained idle during I/O operations, resulting in inefficiency.
  
- **Multiprogramming**:
  - The OS could hold multiple programs in memory simultaneously.
  - This allowed for better CPU utilization by running another program while one is waiting for I/O.
  - Increased throughput and efficiency.

## Processor Types

### Uniprocessor
- **Description**:  
  A uniprocessor system has only one CPU on the motherboard.
  
- **Issue**:  
  When a process moves to I/O operations, the CPU becomes idle, leading to lower throughput and reduced efficiency.

- **Throughput**:  
  Number of programs completed in a unit of time.

- **Example**:  
  MS-DOS (Disk Operating System, 1990) â€“ A command-based system with no GUI.

### Multiprocessor
- **Description**:  
  A multiprocessor system has multiple CPUs on the motherboard, allowing concurrent processing of multiple tasks.
  
- **Objective**:  
  Maximize CPU utilization, improve efficiency, and increase throughput.

- **Impression**:  
  Provides the impression of multiplexing the CPU among different programs.

### Multitasking Operating System
- In **Unix**, a "program" is equivalent to a "task" in **Windows**. Both refer to the same concept of multitasking within an operating system.

- **Impact**:  
  CPU utilization is increased, and idleness is decreased.

## Types of Multiprogramming

### Preemptive Multiprogramming
- **Definition**:  
  The operating system can forcibly deallocate a process from the CPU to ensure that all tasks receive a fair share of CPU time, particularly under the following conditions:
  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - **Time-Slicing**: Each process is allocated a specific time quantum. If it does not complete within that time, it is preempted, and the CPU is allocated to the next process.
  - **Priority Scheduling**: Higher priority tasks can preempt lower priority ones, allowing the system to respond quickly to critical processes.
  
### Non-Preemptive Multiprogramming
- **Definition**:  
  No process is forced to leave the CPU; it will release the CPU voluntarily when it completes its task or requires I/O operations.
  
- **Release Conditions**:  
  - The process completes all its instructions.
  - The process requires I/O operations.
  - A system call is made.

---

### Drawbacks of Non-Preemptive Multiprogramming
- **Starvation**:  
  Some processes may experience indefinite waiting for CPU access if higher priority processes keep running.
  
- **Lack of Interactivity**:  
  Responsiveness may be poor, as a long-running process can block others from executing.

---

### Preemptive Multiprogramming
- **Definition**:  
  In preemptive multiprogramming, the operating system can forcibly remove a process from the CPU to improve responsiveness and CPU utilization.

- **Examples**:  
  Operating systems like Windows 95, Windows 11, Unix, Linux, and macOS employ preemptive multitasking.

#### Improvements in Responsiveness
- The OS can deallocate a process that is hogging CPU time, allowing other waiting programs a chance to run.

---

### Pre-emption Mechanisms
- **Time-based Preemption**:  
  - If the OS allocates a time slice (e.g., 10 seconds) to a process (Px) that neither completes nor goes for I/O, this is characteristic of Multiprogrammed Time Sharing OS.
  
- **Priority-based Preemption**:  
  - If a higher-priority process (Py) arrives while a lower-priority process (Px) is running, the OS can remove Px from the CPU, allowing Py to execute.
