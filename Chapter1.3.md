# 1.3 Types of Operating Systems

### 1st Generation - No Operating System
- **Manual operation**: 
  - Early computers had no operating system.
  - Programs were executed manually by users, often using switches and punch cards.

### 2nd Generation - Magnetic Tapes (No Operating System)
- **Batch Processing**: 
  - Programs were loaded sequentially using punch cards and magnetic tapes.
  - There was no operating system, and users interacted directly with hardware.

### 3rd Generation - Magnetic Disk (Hard Disk) & Floppy Disk
- **Uniprogramming**: 
  - The OS could hold a single program in memory at a time.
  - CPU remained idle during I/O operations, resulting in inefficiency.
  
- **Multiprogramming**:
  - The OS could hold multiple programs in memory simultaneously.
  - This allowed for better CPU utilization by running another program while one is waiting for I/O.
  - Increased throughput and efficiency.
