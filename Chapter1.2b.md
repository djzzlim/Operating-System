# Goals of the Operating System

- **Convenience**: User-friendly interface and experience.
- **Efficiency**: Optimal utilization of resources.
- **Reliability**: Consistent achievement of goals and tasks.
- **Robustness**: Strong enough to handle errors and failures.
- **Scalability**: Ability to evolve and handle increased loads.
- **Portability**: Capability to work across different platforms.

## Unix vs. Windows
- **Unix**: Generally more efficient, reliable, and robust compared to Windows.
- **Windows**: Convenience.

## Functions of an Operating System
- **Processor Management**: Handles CPU scheduling and process execution.
- **Memory Management**: Manages the allocation and deallocation of memory space as needed by programs.

### Convenience is Not the Primary Goal for All OS
In certain types of operating systems, such as real-time systems, the primary goals shift. For these systems, reliability and efficiency become the main objectives due to strict deadlines.
